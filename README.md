### Description
 - Our solution we take Android as App. Our members aim 
   our solution to take as many student they can use for their education, that's why we picked android app
  
   
  
  - For the backend, we use Google Cloud Messaging for Android, as it was understandable to
   integrate with the Android app, without any problem to manage & create the app.
   
   - For sign-up & authentication, we used Google Cloud Messaging auth. If any student, we'll ask you to submit an EMAIL ID. They can submit their EMAIL ID
   -  Unlike their counterparts in cities, a lower percentage of students in villages possess desktop or laptop computers. They depend on their family members’ mobile phones for learning and attending classes, making it an arduous exercise. Watching small screens to consume as much information as possible for long hours could be detrimental to students’ health.
   -  . Moreover, people in rural areas have to also deal with intermittent power supply and older electronic devices, which are often a hindrance to seamless access.
   -  Starts from backlogs, quick revision, motivation videos, all book materials. This website or app different from others because they have only main materials but they don't understand what  are problems students are facing. This app give every solution to them.
